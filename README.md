# Twitter-Hate-Speech-Detection-Using-Various-Machine-Learning-Models

ABSTRACT

The proliferation of social media and video-games has increased the level of online communication worldwide, necessitating the development of a machine that can discern between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral or positive exchanges. In light of the hate speech issue, I have explored various models - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC, and LSTM - with Word2Vec using Twitter data to determine the most effective combination for identifying and detecting online hate speech. Online toxic behaviour - which I have personally experienced playing video-games - exacerbates the mental health crisis among youth, contributing to depression, insecurity, and even teenage suicide rates. In addition, the pressure of life-changing decisions like college applications makes this demographic even more susceptible to the harmful consequences of online hate speech. In order to address this issue, I experimented with Word2Vec and non-deep learning algorithms and more complex architectures like LSTM. Out of all the baseline models - Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and SVC - the combination of Word2Vec and SVC had the maximum accuracy and recall of 85.6%, precision of 80.8%, and F1 score of 83.1%. However, with the LSTM model, I achieved a higher accuracy of 97.18%, recall of 96.95%, precision of 97.42%, and F1 score of 97.18%. Drawing on these results, it is reasonable to conclude that in a high-context problem like detecting hate speech, it is crucial to use more contextual models or neural networks like LSTM.
